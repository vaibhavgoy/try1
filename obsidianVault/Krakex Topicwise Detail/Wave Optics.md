1.  Path Difference, Maxima and Minima: 
2.  Principle of Superposition : Interference of waves, path difference 
3.   YDSE with Monochromatic Light: Fringe width, phase difference intensity of fringes
4.   Huygen's Principle and Wavefronts: Coherrent sources, fringe patterns 
5.   Complications in YDSE and Optical Path Length: Different slit arrangements, 
6.   Diffraction: single slit diffraction pattern
7.   Thin Film Interference and Fresnel bi-prism:
