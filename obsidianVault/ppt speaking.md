Hello goodmoring Everyone, myself vaibhav gupta so let's get started
Water stress and Recent irrigation technologies

1. so first of all 
why this topic 'n'
we need to know how water stress is linked with irrigation. so we are living in india and india is in the land of agriculture n cultivation since centuries and majority of water is used in irrigation purposes. so to  control water stress we need to induce advances in irrigation technologies to increase the efficiency of irrigation practices.

2. we all now that 70 % of earth is covered with water so isn't this is surprising why scarsity of such a abundant substance.
let's have a look of water distribution on earth

3. approximately 97% of the water is contained by seas and oceans........then read the slide
4. now le'ts get some info about rainfall distribution too .. avg rain in the country is 125 cm recieved majorly in 3 months on the contrary rajastshan recieves the minimum that is 60 cm of annual rainfall
5.   here we have a map showing the rainfall distrubution in the country and the graph showing the rainfall we get along the year.
6.   so let's now proceed to groundwater which is used widely for irrigation and domestic purposes.
      In accordance with the data 90% of the ground water extracted is used for irrigation. For the sake of groundwater we need to utilise the run off of rain water.
7.    (read the slide)
8. also  after the free electricity policy ground water level detoriated drastically as number of tubewells and borewells were diggen  to draw out the water from the ground
9.  54% of the country faces high to extremely high shortage of water also here we can get a look of the way water is getting consumed in the country.
10.  in accordance with this map we can presicely see that how we are abruptly increasing our consumption of water.
11. through this pie chart its precise that india contributes 17% of the world population but on the contrary only 4 % of the world water resources.
so let's coming to irrigation practices
11. these are the traditional irrigation practices that are majorly being carried out in india.
###Canal Irrigation
12. in this system narrow less branched  canals are made to provide water to fields...
around 25% of the total irrigation is done by this method inspite of the fact that 35 - 40 % of the water is being wasted.
13.  advantage in canal system is that it does'nt depletes the ground water but on the contrary here couses clogging, mosquito breeding and a lot of water wastage as well.
###Furrow Irrigation
14.  here in this method a hole pipeline is laid all along the slopy field.
this irrigates large area quickly with less manual power and economically.
15.  imbalanced flow wastes a lot of water and due to excess water underground salts come to the surface layer.
###Tubewell Irrigation
16. here 3-25 meter deep tube or bore wells are dug mostly in the areas rich in groundwater level such as river basins.
use of tubewell increased to 46% in 2015 from 31 % in 2002.
17.  indeed it is a cheaper and reliable source of inspite of knowing that it depletes ground water table drastically it is wide used.
###Basin Irrigation
so now let's get smthing about one more traditional irrigation method that is basin irrigation.
18.  in Basin irrigation raised platform thanvla is built arround crops connected to each other distributing water all over the field
19.   this is somewhat economically inclined but requires manual labour also a lot of water gets waste here.

20. so  these inefficient irrigation practices and prevailing water stress gave birth to the advancement in irrigation technologies.
so proceeding ahead..
21.  in the race of modern irrigation methods prominent ones are drip , surface and sprinkler irrigtion
 let's have a brief of these irrigation methods,one by one
 ###sprinkler
22.  In this method pipeline perpendicular to the field is connected with revolving nozzles from which water is sprinkled across a area like raindrops.
this can be implemented also for application of fertilizers pesticides etc.
###Drip
23.  It is a bit complex method in which a pipeline is laid with emitters at different spacing directly near the roots of the plant.
mERITS here are that.. levling of field is not required and it is the most optimum method of irrigation.
24.  these are the stats how drip irrigation technology maximise the production  with minimal use of water and energy.
###Surface Irrigation
25.  Read the slide
26.  here we have data from ministry of agriculture  reflecting the implimentation of drip and sprinkler irrigation with their penetration in gross sown area in INdia .
27.  now comes the microirrigation revenue generation from different states. It is really appreciating Telengana and andra hold 25% of revenue generation in microirriagation market.
28.   so let's get a look of the comparision between  modern irrigation methods.
n we came to know that drip irrigation is precisely efficient over sprinkiler and surface irrigation methods. Drip irrigation provides upto 90% efficient irrigation.

29. Finally we came to imacts of modern irrigation. .....

n this enhances the farmer's income by 42%
further integrating smart technologies with these methods will be quite innovative.
From here my friend mr. sid will be proceeding further.
