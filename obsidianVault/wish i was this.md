bhool jao uss confession ko, galti ho gai mujhse;
fir na hoga aisa kabhi, vaada karta hun tujhse;
bas rahna mere saath hamesha tu qnki,
milte hai tere jaise dost bahaut kismat se;

tumhe or jaan ne ke liye ek kadam tumhari or badaya hai
maine bahut himmat kar ek confession likha hai
plz aacha na lage to gussa mat hona yaar,
jo bola dil ne vo confession mai bataya hai

not posted till yet..

tere paas yahin hun, ye aawaaz mai hi hun,
teri yaadon mai hi jeeta marta rahun,

The knack of editing MY artistic creation is really alluring

 Water is important for agriculture for having good yield. These water resources in India are distributed unevenly. The increasing demands on water resources by India’s huge population and degrading quality of existing water resources because of pollution and the additional requirements of serving India’s industrial and agricultural growth have led to a situation where the consumption of water is rapidly increasing while the supply of fresh water remains more or less constant. Nearly 40% of water demand in urban India is met by ground water. As a result ground water tables in most cities are falling at alarming rate of 2-3 meters per year.1 Water scarcity has many negative impacts on the environment, including lakes, rivers, wetlands, and other fresh water resources. Additionally, water overuse can cause water shortage, often occurs in areas of irrigation agriculture, and harms the environment in several ways including increased salinity, nutrient pollution, and the degradation and loss of flood plains and wetlands. Furthermore, water shortage makes flow management in the rehabilitation of urban streams problematic. Owing to poor water resource management system and climate change India faces a persistent water shortage. As per OECD environmental outlook 2050, India would face severe water shortage by 2050. Indian agriculture accounts for 90% water use due to fast track ground water depletion and poor irrigation systems
